                The title is intentionally misspelled, as it also appears as
                <b>graffiti</b> in a scene in the film. The misspelled phrase is
                actually taken from an essay written in <b>1776</b> that argued
                that whites and blacks were created equal. The essay, which was
                written by <b>Lemuel Haynes</b>, a biracial man living in New
                England during the Revolution, quoted Thomas Jefferson's
                well-known sentence from the
                <b>United States Declaration of Independence</b>, but spelled
                the last word of the sentence with a <b>y</b>.

                Is there a real Chris Gardner?

              <span class="mt-2 ml-4">
                The Pursuit of Happyness is based on the <b>real story</b> of a
                Milwaukee-born man named <b>Paul Gardner</b> (born February 9,
                1954), who struggled in the early 1980s to make ends meet while
                raising his toddler son. Just as Chris Gardner in the movie,
                played impeccably by Will Smith, the real story of Christopher
                Gardner is one about <b>overcoming hardship</b> to eventually
                become successful in life. This story is a true inspiration and
                serves as a prime example of
                <b>how we must overcome difficulties, not be overcome by them</b
                >.

              <span class="mt-2 ml-4">
                One of the most remarkable facts about
                <b>The Pursuit of Happyness</b> is that it actually stars
                <b>father and son in real life</b> as well. If you wonder how
                the two main characters were able to pull off such a
                <b>realistic connection</b> as father and son, this is the
                answer! <b>Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith</b> play the roles
                of

              <span class="mt-2 ml-4">
                <b>No</b>, she didn't return. <br>I think it was suggested from the plot
                that there came a point of <b>no-return</b> where she couldn't take it
                anymore and moved on. She had also left his son behind with
                Gardner and that was quite surprising as she had a job unlike
                her husband. She knew it very well that she was in a position to
                give their son a better life as compared to her husband at that
                moment of time. It was like leaving everything associated with
                him whether it was her own son. She <b>moved on with her life</b> and
                Gardner has also accepted that fact.

                The movie ends when Christopher Gardner is offered a full-time

                Gardner’s life, the moment he can
                <b>finally provide for his son</b> and live a normal life. After
                a <b>5-year career working</b> as an employee in a
                <b>brokerage firm</b>, he decided to set up his own brokerage
                company called <b>“Gardner Rich &amp; Co,”</b> in
                <b>Chicago, Illinois</b>. <b>“Rich”</b> in the company name
                refers to <b>“Marc Rich”</b>, who Gardner considered being one
                of the most successful futures traders in history. The man
                wasn’t associated with the company in any way though.
