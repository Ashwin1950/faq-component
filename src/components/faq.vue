                The title is intentionally misspelled, as it also appears as
                <b>graffiti</b> in a scene in the film. The misspelled phrase is
                actually taken from an essay written in <b>1776</b> that argued
                that whites and blacks were created equal. The essay, which was
                written by <b>Lemuel Haynes</b>, a biracial man living in New
                England during the Revolution, quoted Thomas Jefferson's
                well-known sentence from the
                <b>United States Declaration of Independence</b>, but spelled
                the last word of the sentence with a <b>y</b>.

              <span class="mt-2 ml-4">
                The Pursuit of Happyness is based on the <b>real story</b> of a
                Milwaukee-born man named <b>Paul Gardner</b> (born February 9,
                1954), who struggled in the early 1980s to make ends meet while
                raising his toddler son. Just as Chris Gardner in the movie,
                played impeccably by Will Smith, the real story of Christopher
                Gardner is one about <b>overcoming hardship</b> to eventually
                become successful in life. This story is a true inspiration and
                serves as a prime example of
                <b>how we must overcome difficulties, not be overcome by them</b
                >.

                One of the most remarkable facts about
                <b>The Pursuit of Happyness</b> is that it actually stars
                <b>father and son in real life</b> as well. If you wonder how
                the two main characters were able to pull off such a
                <b>realistic connection</b> as father and son, this is the
                answer! <b>Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith</b> play the roles
                of
                <b

                The movie ends when Christopher Gardner is offered a full-time
                job at the company he followed the <b>internship training</b>.
                This moment is basically only the start of the major change in
                Gardner’s life, the moment he can
                <b>finally provide for his son</b> and live a normal life. After
                a <b>5-year career working</b> as an employee in a
                <b>brokerage firm</b>, he decided to set up his own brokerage
                company called <b>“Gardner Rich &amp; Co,”</b> in
                <b>Chicago, Illinois</b>. <b>“Rich”</b> in the company name
                refers to <b>“Marc Rich”</b>, who Gardner considered being one
                of the most successful futures traders in history. The man
                wasn’t associated with the company in any way though.

                briefly looks back and smiles at him as he and his son leisurely
                stroll around the streets of San Francisco.
